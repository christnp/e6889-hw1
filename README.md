# ELEN-E6889 Homework 1
#### By:  Nick Christman
#### Due: 02.19.2018

## Assumptions:
1. Log file is saved in proper, UTF-8 encoding
2. Log file format is consistent (see source code comment for ParseLogFn())

## Discussion:
Refer to report.

## Notes:
I did not mask web links, except when specifially told to (i.e., Part 4)

Make sure that you follow the instructions of deliverability. Please put the codes for each part into a separate folder and name them "hw1_part1", "hw1_part2", "hw1_part3" and "hw1_4".  Your final submission should include four aforementioned folders, a report and the data file you use.

Your report should describe how your codes implement the homework (1-2 pages).  Below is an example for you. You do not necessarily follow the sample.

" Part 1: Read in the data file. Find the strings that 'xxx'. Use the command 'xxx' to do 'xxx'. The output format for each IP address is 'xxx'.

Part 2: Do part 1 again, and run 'xxx' command to 'xxx'.

..."

For IP address like "query2.lycos.cs.cmu.edu", you can aggregate them by the first two words, i.e. "query2.lycos.*.*". You do not necessarily to ping to find their IPs.
